ChapterFour exercises:
4.1 a) sequence, iteration, selection.
    b) if....else.
    c) counter-controlled.
    d) sentinel, signal, flag or dummy.
    e) sequence.
    f) zero.
    g) prefixed.
    h) eight.
    	
4.2 a) true.
    b) false.
    c) false.
    d) true.
    e) true.
    f) false.
    g) false.
    h) false.
    i) false.
    j) true.
 
4.3 a) x += 1;
    b) x ++;
    c) ++ x;
    d) x = x + 1;

4.4 a) z = x + y; x += 1;
    b) count = 0; 
       if (count > 10){System.out.print("Count is greater than 10")}
    c) x -= 1; --x; total = x;
    d) q %= divisor;
       q = q % divisor; 

4.5 a) int sum = 0;
    b) int x = 1;
    c) sum += x
    d) System.out.print("The sum is :" + sum);

4.6 
	public class Calculate{
	public static void main(String[] marz){
	int numb = 1;
	int sum = 0;
	while( numb <= 10){sum += numb; ++numb;
}
System.out.printf("The sum is: %d%n", sum);

}


}


4.7   int x = 5;
      5 *= x++;


4.8  a) right braces is missing.
     b) there is no need for a semicolon after else.
	
4.9  There will be an infinite loop if the program is executed.


4.10 similarities: They both repeat a specific action while a condition      
     is true.
                   
     differences: 'if' is used for single selection statement while 'while' is
     used for iterational statement.                 

 
4.11 The compiler ignores the fraction and displays the result as an integer, 
      this can be avoided by using a float or a double instead of integer when        
      initializing variables.
	

4.12 Using if else and nested if else statement.


4.13 Sentinel controlled iteration , counter controlled iteration.
     In the first objective the number of user input is not known so
